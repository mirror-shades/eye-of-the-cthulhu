A set of interactive character sheets for Call of Cthulhu TTRPG. Built using Svelete/Tailwind/DaisyUI. The site runs off of two google sheets, one private and one public. Players can keep track of their own character using the public sheet, and info which the Keeper would like to hide such as HP and Sanity can be kept secret.

to run:
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
